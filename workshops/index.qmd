# About

These workshops are designed to help develop data analysis and computing skills in the Monash and broader community. Workshops will be hands-on and primarily focus on using R. Most workshops will be hybrid, in-person for the Monash community and also with the possibility to join on zoom. They will be taught by experts on the topics from the [NUMBATs group](https://numbat.space/people/).
