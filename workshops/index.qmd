title: "NUMBAT Workshops"

# About

These workshops are designed to help develop data analysis and computing skills in the Monash and broader community. Workshops will be hands-on and primarily focus on using R. Most workshops will be hybrid, in-person for the Monash community and also with the possibility to join on zoom. They will be taught by experts on the topics from the [NUMBATs group](https://numbat.space/people/). 

Workshops are organised along three themes: 

- **Learning from data**: extracting data from various sources, tidying, wrangling, modelling, analysis, exploratory data graphics.
- **Data science productivity**: reproducibility, collaboration, literate programming, efficient coding, sharing code.
- **Communicating with data**: effective visualisation, storytelling, engineering interactive web apps, publishing software.

# Other workshops 

## Monash

[eResearch maintains a list](https://docs.erc.monash.edu/training/) of other groups offering workshops and links to the workshops on campus. These are primarily run by eResearch and the [Monash Bioinformatics Platform](https://www.monash.edu/researchinfrastructure/bioinformatics/training). The [eResearch newsletter](https://mailchi.mp/e0c3342ff59a/eresearch-march-2025-newsletter) provides regular details, also. 

## Elsewhere

The [Statistical Society of Australia](https://www.statsoc.org.au/Events-calendar), in particular the Statistical Computing and Visualisation Section, regularly run workshops which are listed on their events page.
